### Caveat
The software is _permanently evolving_: the common functions: display, menu, data processing, statistics serial functions and dashboard functionalities are operative.  
Drok-Juntek-on-steroids is the root project with basic common functions to control the DC converters.
Several dervatives are (will be) provided with specific functionalities:

## MPPT Solar controller: https://github.com/rin67630/Soft-Power2-MPPT, operative.
## Solar panel emulation: yet to come
## Electronic load: yet to come
## Programmable battery charger: yet to come
## more...

# Explanations about the software.
I like software being easy to read, close to natural language.  
The Arduino IDE is a very accessible development environment, that hides the complexity of C++ language to the beginners.
My code makes also extensive use of compiler directives to determine different options and avoid having to dig into the code to change a user setting.  
For the sake of clarity I made an extensive use of comments, especially commenting why I realized the code that way.  
I refrained as far as possible to use geek jargon that requires C++ expertise beyond what an Arduino user with reasonable experience can understand. 
The Arduino IDE provides the possibility to split the code into separate tabs for clarity.

## Functional blocks
I used that feature to organize my code in functional blocks:
1. ESP_SwissArmyKnife: comment-only, a short description of the target, license terms.  
   Credentials: where to place your confidential data.
2. a0_Parameters: options defined by compiler directives. __This will be the main place for users to tamper with.__
3. a1 Libs_Vars: libraries and variables required by the program.
4. b_Functions: the function subroutines used by the program.
5. c_Setup: The setup process that runs once upon booting the ESP
6. d_Menu: The serial menu that can be used to adjust parameters and request some reports on the serial line.
7. e_Data: The main processing routine
8. f_Stats: Computing the statistics 
9. g_Display: The code intended to display current information on the OLED displays
10. h_Serial: The code intended to issue the serial reports called by the menu.
11. i_Wireless: The code to exchange information with the thinger.io Dashboard and other devices
12. j_Loop: The scheduling loop controlling all previous tasks.
13. k_Thinger Dasboard:   comment-only, the JSON content of a dashboard example at thinger.io provided here for convenience.
14. r_ReadMe: comment-only, mainly for myself contains some syntaxes, that my limited brain tends to forget.
15. y_ParkedCode: comment-only, containing parts of the code intended for further usage. 

The code separation into functional blocks makes it much easier to jump between several tasks.
